  edit: {
    featureGroup: drawnItems
    edit: {
      moveMarkers: false // centroids, default: false
    }
  }
});
map.addControl(drawControl);
// aaand you are good to go, all vector paths are draggable in edit mode

```

npm install leaflet-draw-drag
...

require('leaflet');
var drawControl = require('leaflet-draw-drag'); // requires leaflet-draw
```

## Info

Uses and includes [Leaflet.Path.Drag](https://github.com/w8r/Leaflet.Path.Drag)
to extend vector features with drag functionality, so you can create draggable
polygons and polylines programmatically if you have this one included in your
app.

```javascript
var polygon = new L.Polygon([...], { draggable: true }).addTo(map);
polygon
    .on('dragstart', onDragStart)
    .on('drag',      onDrag)
    .on('dragend',   onDragEnd);
```

## Development

```
npm install && npm start
```
Build
```
npm run build
```
